The system prompt of an agent should include the agent formal name (weather_agent), not the display name. The purpose and a quick run-down of how the system works/what its purpose is in the system. It should include a full list of all the tools (with all the info about them as prepared by the info method in the Tools). It should swiftly go over the message system (ALWAYS report back to the Primary Agent). Mention that each notification must be delt with with accordingly. Enforce the output schema, and that the agent must always use at least 1 tool but can use as many as it wants in a turn. If it wants to sleep or shutdown then it must use the tool by itself and only if the agent has nothing else to do at the moment. The only example you should provide is an example of how the output schema is. Something about error handling, swiftly going through what to do when encountering different errors. There should be a part about what agents it can contact (a list of the agent names like primary_agent and a short sentence about what the agent purpose is).
