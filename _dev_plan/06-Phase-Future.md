# Phase 5: Self-Improvement & Future Vision

**Objective:** To realize the ultimate vision of the project: an AI system that can understand its own codebase and assist in its own development, expanding its capabilities over time.

**Key Outcomes by End of Phase:**
- A secure, sandboxed environment for code development.
- A team of "developer agents" capable of reading, writing, and testing code.
- A human-in-the-loop approval process for all code changes.
- The first complex VOS application (Games App) as a capstone project.

### Tasks

#### 1. Create a Secure Development Sandbox
- **Status:** [ ] Not Started
- **Task:** Set up an isolated environment where coding agents can work without risk to the live production system.
- **Sub-Tasks:**
    - [ ] Create a script that can spin up a fully containerized, ephemeral copy of the entire VOS stack.
    - [ ] Grant the developer agents access to a sandboxed copy of the Git repository.
- **Notes:** The coding agents must NEVER have direct access to the live production environment or its secrets.

#### 2. Develop the Coding Agent Team
- **Status:** [ ] Not Started
- **Task:** Design a multi-agent team that mimics a software development workflow.
- **Sub-Tasks:**
    - [ ] **Manager Agent:** Breaks down high-level features (e.g., "Add a new tool to the Weather Agent") into tasks on the shared task list.
    - [ ] **Programmer Agent:** Picks up coding tasks, reads existing files, writes new code, and modifies files. Its tools are `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `list_directory`.
    - [ ] **QA Agent:** Picks up completed code, writes and executes tests against it in the sandbox, and reports success or failure.
- **Notes:** This workflow leverages the multi-agent task list system developed in Phase 2.

#### 3. Implement Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for Code Changes
- **Status:** [ ] Not Started
- **Task:** Ensure a human must approve all code generated by the agent team.
- **Sub-Tasks:**
    - [ ] The final step for the developer agent workflow is to commit the code to a new branch and open a **Pull Request** on GitHub.
    - [ ] A human developer must manually review this pull request, approve it, and perform the merge into the main branch.
- **Notes:** This is the most critical safety and quality control measure.

#### 4. Build the Games App
- **Status:** [ ] Not Started
- **Task:** As a capstone project, build a VOS application for interactive games.
- **Sub-Tasks:**
    - [ ] Design a Games API that allows agents to query the game state and submit moves.
    - [ ] Implement a simple game first (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe).
    - [ ] Implement a more complex strategy game (e.g., a simplified version of "Global Thermonuclear War" or a text-based adventure).
- **Notes:** This will be the ultimate test of the system, requiring agents to use reasoning, memory, and tools in a complex, interactive environment against a human or each other.
